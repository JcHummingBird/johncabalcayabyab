	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Training Before Getting Onboard</h4>
	  <p"> Pre-employment training should meet the requirements of gaming regulators in any jurisdiction, if any, and should reflect the needs of the company and the prospective employee.<br> 
	  The selection process for prospective employees is critical. <br>
	  The person in-charge of the selection process must have the ability to spot the characters of a prospective employee that is vital to becoming a future Surveillance Officer. The former should be able to accurately assess and evaluate the characters of prospective employees before giving his nod.<br>
	  The person-in-charge of the training should demonstrate the competency of a Surveillance material himself because prospective employee relies heavily on the Trainer.<br>
	  <p>The Scope of the Training. Prospective Surveillance Officer<br>
	  The scope of training is huge and complex in an integrated property that operates hotel, casino, MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions), retail, restaurants and other attractions. That means a prospective Surveillance Officer has to learn basic knowledge of all the operations or to be aware at least of the operations in an integrated property before he/she can set foot in the surveillance room. <br>
	  And why is that?<br>
	  In the olden days of surveillance operations, the bulk of training is focus on understanding and knowledge of how the casino games are operated. Secondary to that is learning cage operations which is concentrated on finding cage variance, monitoring fills and credits, drop box issuance and collection, etc.<br>
	  A prospective Surveillance Officer also has to dive-in on Slot Operations with understanding of machine error, machine opening, jackpot validations, hopper fills and the like. <br>
	  Finally, learning Security Operations like basic knowledge of "walkie/talkie or hand-held radio" and NATO phonetics, co-sign, providing coverage of suspects invited to the security interview room and reviews. These are just basics.<br>
	  Receiving calls from internal customers is random and there is no option to choose. If you don't have any knowledge or a single clue of each of the mentioned operations in the integrated property and don't know how to process the call received, you will be a "sitting duck" and could jeopardize the Surveillance Operations.

	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Managing People</h4>
	  <p><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/300567/what-appear-to-be-means-in-the-given-sentence" target="_blank">Reference: english.stackexchange.com</a></p>
	  <p>A Surveillance Operations with a manpower of over two hundred is a huge operation.<a href="file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/Bio/digitalAgeOfSurveillance.html" target="_blank">(Related: digitalAgeOfSurveillance)</a><br>

	  It is likely to be an integrated resort wih international and local markets combined. This manpower is so diverse that most often, there is a confusion about the requirements on how one becomes who he is in the hierarchy and what exactly is this person's role in the organization.<br>

	  So diverse that people comes from countries with local casinos, with diverse work experiences, education and economic status pooled and aligned to be included in the team that will run a huge surveillance operations.<br>

	  The system of getting the title or promotion one is pursuing is not only confined to efficiently knowing things, educational background(which is often undermined), who runs the operation, personal network/circle of friends and fortunate events(like detecting a scam) that would bypass others ambitions. Unfortunately, there is no clear path to getting up the ladder. Perhaps because people perceived the job as a white collar, sadly it is not. Looking and comparing some of the jurisdictions/state that an Officer of a casino surveillance is compared to a factory worker earning meager income. So often soon, high expectation during the onset of becoming a surveillance officer tends to bend to an eroding shift or decline in the excitement. Partly because after a realization of economic/financial benefits, the rigid requirements to preserve your job, comparison of a job from other department with parallel or same level of qualification, volume of knowledge to absorb and the pressure of not committing an error when passing information both internally and externally, limited space and limited social activites within the property.</p><br>

	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Camera Handling and Monitoring Skills</h4>
	  <p>Imagine driving a car and you shifted your full attention away from the road. What happens is that you are multi-tasking and that carries a risk. Multi-tasking is a distraction, and that causes a failure to observe relevant incidents. Monitoring and camera handling is similar to driving a car where you need to focus on the road and needs a well-trained hands with the gear and steering wheel.<br>

	  Full attention doesn't mean a fixed stare(which will strain your eyes) on the monitor - which according to studies reduces brain activity. You need to focus your eyes and move them only to the ongoing activity.<br>

	  It is important that you are familiar with the widely-used PTZ cameras. I suggest you memorize cameras that are of routine used and those that covers wide areas.<br>

	  You should have the ability to calculate camera angle so as not to block the intended view.<br>

	  Move the camera with a valid and rational purpose. Wandering doesn't help and you are negatively exploiting company resources. I see Operators shifting their attention away from the monitor while the PTZ is moving. I am certain this un-professional and un-productive but is being tolerated. Everyone knows that this doesn't make any sense and yet stil being
	  practice.<br>

	  I also need to emphasize that without a knowledge or a hint of what you are monitoring is comparable to driving over the edge of a cliff.</p><br>

	  <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Footage Review. Appeared To Be. Part 1</h4>
	  <p>When asked to verify a CCTV footage whether an event did exist, the "hope" is that footage could clearly show what has occurred. There were occasions that because footage is not clear, or a technology is not available to enhance or refine a footage, we are down to the probability but presume. Our mind is weighing several factors, including the most significant of all factors: Time is ticking, before we call down to the internal customers (Table Games, Cage, EGM/Slots, Hotel, Retail etc.).<br> 
	  Now that we presumed that an event did  or did not occur, based on several factors available (i.e. partly clear CCTV footage, testimonials from trusted sources, experience, historical events), we now call down to the internal customers to state that "..it appeared to be that an event existed".<br> Appeared to be, YES, that is our standpoint, because CCTV footage could not confirm the event, because CCTV footage could not clearly divulge the event. Don't get me wrong, because I did not assume and there was no guessing game. It was probability, not possibility. Later, a follow-up call was received from our internal customers contesting our review. These and more will be discussed in the next topic.</p>
	  <p><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/300567/what-appear-to-be-means-in-the-given-sentence" target="_blank">Reference: english.stackexchange.com</a></p><br>

	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Footage Review. Appeared To Be. Part 2</h4>
	<p>Be as a Surveillance Shift Manager, Surveillance Supervisor or Officer, or whoever in the hierarchy who noted the complaint - i.e., contesting our review, the instant thought or reaction was "Did we review the footage correctly?, or did we provide the incorrect information (or mis-information)?". It's a human nature to react that way.<br>
	Surveillance, given the status quo as the last line of defence, couldn't afford to be wrong when it comes to reviewing footage.<br>
	The notion that any information received from anyone is that we have to conduct a review is a "default" action, because the equipment is there to be utilized. To cut to the chase, we must be expert in footage review.<br>
	So much for defending my argument, the question is - what needs to be done when this arose?<br>
	If the party (more often a Surveillance Officer and a Surveillance Supervisor) who conducted the review has confirmed that the footage is partly clear and could not conclude as 100% fool proof, and this information has been relayed to the internal customers, then the only thing that we could offer is to show the footage to their managers who has the authority to view the footage.<br>
	If the Manager who has viewed the footage has similar conclusion that the footage is partly clear, then a discretion follows. Yes, discretion. The manager who viewed the footage will make a decision based on factors affecting the interest of the company (i.e., applicable laws, company policies and procedure, footage, financial cost to that effect).</p>

	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Advantage Play, Cheats, Collusion, Scam</h4>
	<p>Eventually, a casino cheater will be caught, plain and simple.<br>
	Casinos are consistently checking and evaluating their win/loss, and when a fluctuation is seen and cannot be reconciled on several metrics, such as current float balance and player rating, a warning bell is sounded.</p><br>

	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Why People Do Not Maximize Their Potential At Work, Or In Anywhere Else?</h4>
	<p>In the workplace, maximizing your potential means able to meet standards, consistently meet the standards, and exceed the standards to standout, but what is the cost of doing it, and how many people get the accolades for doing it. 
	A team member who has a positive goal will align his character to maximize his or her full potential. He will accept instructions faithfully. He is creative. He helps a fellow team member who is struggling at work. He reads, writes, ask questions, test, re-try and re-start. He accepts defeat but knows that defeat will not keep him from moving forward  - resiliency!.<br>
	A positive goal is something constructive and benefit both the person who envisioned it and the people around him. You need to eliminate activities and habits that are not helping you to achieve and maximize your full potential. And what are these activities and habits? You can list them but depending on the situation you are in, some in the list are not impacting your road to maximizing your potential. Say John needs to get a good sleeping habit so that he could focus well, but Jane has no issue about sleeping, but is easily distracted at work or in any activity she is into.<br>
	To help you maximize your full potential, first thing you need to do is reflect on yourself, understand what is missing in your routine, what are the pitfalls you keep on encountering and couldn't adjust to. This part is the one that I struggled, so reflecting on what I did at work and how I treated everyone at work truly matters to me and I have to reflect each and everyday, before, during, or after work - the goal is to improve myself even to its barest, minute degree and un-noticeable level of change in character.<br>
	I could say that if you love what you are doing, as everyone says, you will reach your full potential and fulfill what you've dreamt of. Feeling of of satisfaction and fulfillment, not feeling obligated, puts your physical and mental state at work without revving up and no extra effort needed.<br>
	What if a team encouters a team leader who micromanage? What effect will it has to the team?<a href="file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/Bio/digitalAgeOfSurveillance.html" target="_blank">(Related: digitalAgeOfSurveillance)</a></p><br>

	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Communicating With This Manager</h4>
	<p>Occasionally, I receive phone call from a particular manager who needs to inform our department that an incident occurred or let's say there is a suspect in custody. This manager I would say is speaking English as his second language just like me.<br>
	I am sure this his written communication is better than his oral communication, but that is beside the point.
	He speaks with courtesy, completeness, concreteness, coherence and name alll the other requirements of an effective  communicator - he has them all. Now I know you are asking so what is the issue?<br>

	Try to visualize my plight, I am in-charge with the majority of oral communication with other departments, handling at least 20 people who demand my time infrequently and coming to me un-scheduled and unpredictable and other
	areas of concern in my timetable that are also demanding time, un-scheduled and unpredictable as well.To cut it short - there is a communication overload!<br>

	This particular manager will narrate the story thoroughly, vividly, full of emotions and in detail, only that the length of details means that I need to take note well, fast and with so much effort while I need to tend to other things.<br>
	My always question is, why he could not summarize the message? This goes on and on for years. I was thinking of giving him a hint that he is becoming extremely annoying, sadly demanding by not improving on this aspect - effective
	communication - brief and case.<br>
	I understand that not all persons has the ability to communicate well, until one time, the turn of events came.
	It was my turn to inform this manager of an incident, and by intention, I tried to provide him of a very detailed and
	vivid narration of the event. I was caught off guard when he told me I will just view the footage inside the CCTV
	viewing room because he said and I quote, "my story is too long". That is the statement I wanted to hear from him for a long time, and next time he is just as detailed as me, I will remind him to be more brief and concise, if that is the
	reasonable thing to do.</p><br>

	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">How To Manage Difficult Footage Reviews?</h4>
	<p> Every once in a while, a Surveillance Officer may encounter a footage review that is difficult to confirm.
	Like five patrons claimed for four wagers in Sic Bo or Tai Sai, it is a simple review but if the quality of the footage is
	compromised, then it slows the process. When I say footage is compromised, I do mean the technical aspect of the
	camera recording, perhaps the system is hacked, there is a camera maintenance or camera rectification that needs to be done,
	server issue or patching and others. I can say the footage is compromised in effect, like when patrons are crowding the Sic Bo table,
	their hands crossing each other to place their wagers, change the position of their wagers, claimed for a wager or
	worse claim other peoples wagers.<br>
	The usual reaction of a Surveillance Officer when confronted with this kind of review is that it is a difficult review.
	To a person who is not working in a Surveillance Department, this may sound a simple task. But for a Surveillance Officer
	who is racing against time, when time is limited and the review has to be confirmed, it is like trying to detonate a
	bomb to avoid a nuclear explosion. First the image, Surveillance Officer will ask, what if I could not identify who placed
	or who took other patrons wager, what if the review becomes extensive, what will my Supervisor's impression on me, Pit
	Manager is waiting for my call to provide the result of the footage review? and the list goes on.<br>
	The trick is, stop. Identify the problem and breakdown the problem. Like if there are two sets of claimants in Sic Bo, two claimants of one wager in "Big" that is easily identifiable, and five claimants of four wagers in "Three From Four Possible Combinations" that is more complex, try to resolve the first set of claimants, call the Pit Manager and mentioned that
	we will be settling the issue into two parts.<br>
	Worse comes to worst, if the Surveillance Department is not empowered to resolve the un-solvable incident when the footage
	is completely compromised, call the relevant department (Gaming or Table Games) authorized person (Gaming Shift Manager or next person in hierarchy) to view the footage themselves. At this point, Gaming Shift Manager has to prescibe a remedy and will make a payment to all the claimants - eventually reconciling the table float through adjustment of entry by Audit (back end).<br></p>

	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Impact of Poor Management Decision Or Indecision</h4>
	<p>As part of the Key Performance Indicator (KPI), Management will author a program seeking the issue of decreasing statistics. These statistics perhaps
	are related to Surveillance Officers targeted observations be it Error observations or Procedure violations. A Surveillance Officer has to attain
	a minimum expected figure of those targets, as set by the Management. The instructions and mechanics will be set out in writing as the basis 
	of guidelines to effectively carry out the task. This instructions and mechanics are binding to the Management and Staff. <br>
	But how if in the process, the Management decided to re-configure the targeted statistics. You won't need to analyse the consequences because
	the impact is a three pronged: 1. What will the stakeholders reaction and subsequent decision of the Management, 2. the Management saving face to 
	the stakeholders and the Employees alike and 3. Employees who are dissappointed and disgruntled with the Management's abrupt decision 
	and failure to commit. Management must carefully take note of this poor Management decision because the impact is broader than they could fathom.<br>
	You have to utilize your resources to win back the loyalty and trust of Employees who, and we have to admit, are the backbone and are
	practically the only group that is physically working in the operation.
	<br></p>

	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">How To Handle EGM (Electronic Gaming Machine)/Slot Jackpot</h4>
   <p>As part of minimum risk reduction, Electronic Gaming Machine (EGM) Attendant or Slot Supervisor
      will contact Surveillance to inform that a person playing on a specific EGM has won a progressive
      jackpot, a grand jackpot or any other major jackpot.<br>
      The response of a Surveillance Officer is to find a PTZ camera to focus on that specific EGM and capture
      the image on screen monitor displaying the amount won. After that, Surveillance Officer will utilize 
      a PTZ camera to capture the screen displaying the progressive jackpot display showing the amount won.
      Surveillance Officer will use the PTZ camera to check whether the relevant persons are on the site to
      verify the jackpot (Slot Shift Manager, Gaming Shift Manager and Slot Technical Manager). Also utilize
      the PTZ camera to capture the image of the person who won the jackpot. Surveillance Officer will also 
      monitor when the machine was reset and is operational.<br>
      What else will the Surveillance Officer do.
      Surveillance will check on the software application showing the jackpot amount won, the EGM number and 
      Asset number, any errors, is there a membership card inserted into the EGM and is that membership card
      belong to the winner.<br>
      Surveillance Officer will review footage thirty minutes prior to the recorded time of jackpot and analyse
      the behavior of the jackpot winner, if there are any irregularities, if there are any suspicious actions 
      or suspicious devices or instruments that are noticeable, and if there was any tampering or spilling of 
      liquid onto the EGM.<br>
      Surveillance Officer will call the attention of a Surveillance Supervisor to verify what has been conducted
      by the Surveillance Officer. After the verification, Surveillance Supervisor to inform the Surveillance
      Shift Manager.<br>
      At this point, Surveillance Officer will contact the Slot Supervisor that the review was concluded and that
      no irregularity has been noted. 
      When everybody has completed their checks, payment will follow by preparing a Slot Payout Voucher (SPV) and
      this document will be brought to Cage for payment, amount won to be credited to his account, payment by cheque,
      payment by cash or any combinations of the three.

    <p>Processes to be taken during power failure.<br>
       There are so many areas in an integrated resort and casino that are of Surveillance concern.
       Because the property is under CCTV coverage, therefore, when power is restored, there will be
       multiple requests for footage review.<br>
       And what are these requests for footage review?<br>
       Let us start off with a call from a Pit Manager in the casino area. Pit Manager will call to
       confirm whether a game that is on hold during power interruption is valid and that there are
       are no irregularities. If the power is going to be out for a long window, wagers will be manually
       recorded and safekeep in the float, take down patrons particulars, and once the power is restored,
       Surveillance would verify whether there are no irregularities during the game, pay the winning wagers
       and collect losing wagers, and return the wagers that are standoff/tie.</p>

	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">WorkPlace Safety and Health</h4>
    <p>When we are working, there is a tendency to neglect our basic health needs. One is drinking water,
     failing to hydrate ourserlves when there is a volume of work to be done. We tend to continue focusing on
     the screen monitor when our eye muscles contract and are tired. We become inattentive to hazardous areas of
     the workplace because what we need is to get the job done. We become unmindful of the signage such as
     "wet floor, hazardous element, flammable, do not open and the list goes on."<br>
     What is the point here?<br>
     We earn a living, and by doing so, we need to take care of ourselves. What is the used of getting all the
     excellent remarks from a team member, when you know your limits and has to stop at some point, because your
     health and safety is compromise. You have to comply with the set standards, exceed expectations which 
     fulfills your self-satisfaction and your departments goal. But the irony there is, we comply?, we set our
     work standards high?, but our health and safety are at the bottom level. Don't wait for another team member to
     remind us -  that health and safety matters.          
     It boils down to one thing, we take care of our health and safety, because our family and those that deeply
     cares for us matters most.
