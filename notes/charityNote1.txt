My First Essay About Charity

How can I help? 
How can I share my blessings? How can I tell my less-fortunate brothers and sisters 
that I am thinking of their welfare?

I know the feeling of deprived and the feeling of needing help - in all aspects i.e. financially, emotionally
and you can name the rest, I need them all at that point of time.

What should I do? What actions I need to move forward and find something to alleviate my economic condition?
In affluent countries, I could declare bankruptcy and seek financial assistance from the institution.
