    <p style=line-height:200%>
    Casino Surveillance, like any other departments in casino industry has evolved and has been largely impacted by technology.<br>

    Surveillance has shifted from Video Cassette Recorder (VCR), that records analog video and analog audio; to Digital Video Recorder (DVR), that converts video to digital signals, 
    compresses the file, and stores it on a hard drive; to Network Video Recorder (NVR), that records video footage and stores it into the hard disc, 
    cloud storage or a mass storage device.<br>

    Surveillance Officers are now using a combination of the following for monitoring: tablet computer, joystick and keyboard which offers flexibility because it has more features instead of the plain joystick and keyboard combined.

    Other technologies utilized are Infrared technology, RFID, Biometrics, Artificial Intelligence(AI), Augmented Reality(AR), Data Forensics and much more.<br>

    Software apps were introduced to replace manual forms, ease of monitoring, use in data analysis, communication, training and events handling, inquiry and investigation, 
    procurement and others. <br>

    As such, there is an urgent need for a Surveillance Officer to upgrade and be upskilled to stay relevant in the Surveillance Department.<br>
    Before the digital era begun, Surveillance Officers were only required to learn basic knowledge of casino games, technical report writing skills, understanding player behavior 
    (which could pave the way to detecting casino cheats and scams) and operate analog system as the basic requirements - not anymore.<br>
    Imagine an integrated resort with an average of 2,000 casino visitors per day. How much is your projected size of Surveillance manpower in order to effectively 
    handle incidents on an 8 hour or 10 hour shift? If you have 18 Surveillance Officers, the ratio will be 1:111 visitors. Imagine the responsibility. Do the math.<br>

    The era of Surveillance Department being a support casino group has long gone owing to the huge amount of confidential materials it is handling, 
    the departments it is collaborating (back in the days where Surveillance Department is directly reporting to a Casino Manager is seldom a practice).
    Nowadays, Surveillance is collaborating with various departments (Legal, Compliance, Security and government regulatory agencies).<br>

  
    The era of Surveillance Officers role which cannot be distinguished to a Security Officer role is an obsolete thought - more so a moot and academic.<br>
