   <!-- <h2 class="w3-wide w3-animate-left">ABOUT ME</h2>-->
        <p class="w3-opacity" >  Hi, I am John  Cayabyab, Casino Surveillance Specialist and an enthusiast in Web Development and Data Analysis; has worked in several casinos: Star Cruises in Singapore, Legenda Subic in the Philippines, Genting Subic in the Philippines, Fontana Casino Clark in the  Philippines, Star Vegas in Cambodia, Subic Diamond Casino in the Philippines, MSPI in the Philippines, Venetian Resorts in Macau and Casino Lugano SA in Switzerland<br>
        
        Also worked at commercial banks in the Philippines with primary role in audit, reconciliation and marketing.<br>
 
        To stay relevant in the fast-paced trend in business, I am religiously developing methods and re-inventing my style. When  I developed my interest in Information Technology, driven by several factors and inspired by people closest to me, I instantly became passionate about it realizing it's value. I began learning Software Development, diving deep in applications such as; HTML, CSS, W3-CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Python and SQL to equip himself.<br>

        I developed this website as a 'testament' that I am getting a solid grasp of web development after tedious and long hours of practice. I will try my best to create beautiful websites where hue, design and responsiveness are in harmony. This website will also serve the purpose of imparting my casino surveillance experience and there was no other intention whatsover. I will also make use of this website to write articles related to my understanding of charity, movements and actions related to charity that are intended to help other people in methods that are pure and without hidden agenda.<br> I understand that more errors and failures are still ahead of me, but with the right amount of mind set, combined with hard work, patience and resilience, I could be one notch higher from where I started. "It is just a matter of time".<br>

        I encourage eveyone to write me a note, share your thoughts or write a related article on topics that I've posted. By this, I could expand my understanding of these topics, re-evaluate, re-write and revise my errors.<br>
        
        I studied in Adamson University Manila, Philippines with a degree in Bachelor of Arts in Economics.</p>
