    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Training Before Getting Onboard</h4>
      <p"> Pre-employment training should meet the requirements of gaming regulators in any jurisdiction, if any, and should reflect the needs of the company and the prospective employee.<br> 
      The selection process for prospective employees is critical. <br>
      The person in-charge of the selection process must have the ability to spot the characters of a prospective employee that is vital to becoming a future Surveillance Officer. The former should be able to accurately assess and evaluate the characters of prospective employees before giving his nod.<br>
      The person-in-charge of the training should demonstrate the competency of a Surveillance material himself because prospective employee relies heavily on the Trainer.<br>
      <p>The Scope of the Training. Prospective Surveillance Officer<br>
      The scope of training is huge and complex in an integrated property that operates hotel, casino, MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions), retail, restaurants and other attractions. That means a prospective Surveillance Officer has to learn basic knowledge of all the operations or to be aware at least of the operations in an integrated property before he/she can set foot in the surveillance room. <br>
      And why is that?<br>
      In the olden days of surveillance operations, the bulk of training is focus on understanding and knowledge of how the casino games are operated. Secondary to that is learning cage operations which is concentrated on finding cage variance, monitoring fills and credits, drop box issuance and collection, etc.<br>
      A prospective Surveillance Officer also has to dive-in on Slot Operations with understanding of machine error, machine opening, jackpot validations, hopper fills and the like. <br>
      Finally, learning Security Operations like basic knowledge of "walkie/talkie or hand-held radio" and NATO phonetics, co-sign, providing coverage of suspects invited to the security interview room and reviews. These are just basics.<br>
      Receiving calls from internal customers is random and there is no option to choose. If you don't have any knowledge or a single clue of each of the mentioned operations in the integrated property and don't know how to process the call received, you will be a "sitting duck" and could jeopardize the Surveillance Operations.

    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Managing People</h4>
      <p><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/300567/what-appear-to-be-means-in-the-given-sentence" target="_blank">Reference: english.stackexchange.com</a></p><br>
      <p>A Surveillance Operations with a manpower of over two hundred is a huge operation.<a href="file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/Bio/digitalAgeOfSurveillance.html" target="_blank">(Related: digitalAgeOfSurveillance)</a><br>

      It is likely to be an integrated resort wih international and local markets combined. This manpower is so diverse that most often, there is a confusion about the requirements on how one becomes who he is in the hierarchy and what exactly is this person's role in the organization.<br>

      So diverse that people comes from countries with local casinos, with diverse work experiences, education and economic status pooled and aligned to be included in the team that will run a huge surveillance operations.<br>

      The system of getting the title or promotion one is pursuing is not only confined to efficiently knowing things, educational background(which is often undermined), who runs the operation, personal network/circle of friends and fortunate events(like detecting a scam) that would bypass others ambitions. Unfortunately, there is no clear path to getting up the ladder. Perhaps because people perceived the job as a white collar, sadly it is not. Looking and comparing some of the jurisdictions/state that an Officer of a casino surveillance is compared to a factory worker earning meager income. So often soon, high expectation during the onset of becoming a surveillance officer tends to bend to an eroding shift or decline in the excitement. Partly because after a realization of economic/financial benefits, the rigid requirements to preserve your job, comparison of a job from other department with parallel or same level of qualification, volume of knowledge to absorb and the pressure of not committing an error when passing information both internally and externally, limited space and limited social activites within the property.</p><br>

    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Camera Handling and Monitoring Skills</h4>
      <p>Imagine driving a car and you shifted your full attention away from the road. What happens is that you are multi-tasking and that carries a risk. Multi-tasking is a distraction, and that causes a failure to observe relevant incidents. Monitoring and camera handling is similar to driving a car where you need to focus on the road and needs a well-trained hands with the gear and steering wheel.<br>

      Full attention doesn't mean a fixed stare(which will strain your eyes) on the monitor - which according to studies reduces brain activity. You need to focus your eyes and move them only to the ongoing activity.<br>

      It is important that you are familiar with the widely-used PTZ cameras. I suggest you memorize cameras that are of routine used and those that covers wide areas.<br>

      You should have the ability to calculate camera angle so as not to block the intended view.<br>

      Move the camera with a valid and rational purpose. Wandering doesn't help and you are negatively exploiting company resources. I see Operators shifting their attention away from the monitor while the PTZ is moving. I am certain this un-professional and un-productive but is being tolerated. Everyone knows that this doesn't make any sense and yet stil being
      practice.<br>

      I also need to emphasize that without a knowledge or a hint of what you are monitoring is comparable to driving over the edge of a cliff.</p><br>

      <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Footage Review. Appeared to be. Part 1</h4>
      <p>When asked to verify a CCTV footage whether an event did exist, the "hope" is that footage could clearly show what has occurred. There were occasions that because footage is not clear, or a technology is not available to enhance or refine a footage, we are down to the probability but presume. Our mind is weighing several factors, including the most significant of all factors: Time is ticking, before we call down to the internal customers (Table Games, Cage, EGM/Slots, Hotel, Retail etc.).<br> 
      Now that we presumed that an event did  or did not occur, based on several factors available (i.e. partly clear CCTV footage, testimonials from trusted sources, experience, historical events), we now call down to the internal customers to state that "..it appeared to be that an event existed".<br> Appeared to be, YES, that is our standpoint, because CCTV footage could not confirm the event, because CCTV footage could not clearly divulge the event. Don't get me wrong, because I did not assume and there was no guessing game. It was probability, not possibility. Later, a follow-up call was received from our internal customers contesting our review. These and more will be discussed in the next topic.</p>
      <p><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/300567/what-appear-to-be-means-in-the-given-sentence" target="_blank">Reference: english.stackexchange.com</a></p><br>

    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Footage Review. Appeared to be. Part 2</h4>
    <p>Be as a Surveillance Shift Manager, Surveillance Supervisor or Officer, or whoever in the hierarchy who noted the complaint - i.e., contesting our review, the instant thought or reaction was "Did we review the footage correctly?, or did we provide the incorrect information (or mis-information)?". It's a human nature to react that way.<br>
    Surveillance, given the status quo as the last line of defence, couldn't afford to be wrong when it comes to reviewing footage.<br>
    The notion that any information received from anyone is that we have to conduct a review is a "default" action, because the equipment is there to be utilized. To cut to the chase, we must be expert in footage review.<br>
    So much for defending my argument, the question is - what needs to be done when this arose?<br>
    If the party (more often a Surveillance Officer and a Surveillance Supervisor) who conducted the review has confirmed that the footage is partly clear and could not conclude as 100% fool proof, and this information has been relayed to the internal customers, then the only thing that we could offer is to show the footage to their managers who has the authority to view the footage.<br>
    If the Manager who has viewed the footage has similar conclusion that the footage is partly clear, then a discretion follows. Yes, discretion. The manager who viewed the footage will make a decision based on factors affecting the interest of the company (i.e., applicable laws, company policies and procedure, footage, financial cost to that effect).</p>

    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Advantage Play, Cheats, Collusion, Scam</h4>
    <p>Eventually, a casino cheater will be caught, plain and simple.<br>
    Casinos are consistently checking and evaluating their win/loss, and when a fluctuation is seen and cannot be reconciled on several metrics, such as current float balance and player rating, a warning bell is sounded.</p><br>

    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Why people do not maximize their potential at work, or in anywhere else?</h4>
    <p>In the workplace, maximizing your potential means able to meet standards, consistently meet the standards, and exceed the standards to standout, but what is the cost of doing it, and how many people get the accolades for doing it. 
    A team member who has a positive goal will align his character to maximize his or her full potential. He will accept instructions faithfully. He is creative. He helps a fellow team member who is struggling at work. He reads, writes, ask questions, test, re-try and re-start. He accepts defeat but knows that defeat will not keep him from moving forward  - resiliency!.<br>
    A positive goal is something constructive and benefit both the person who envisioned it and the people around him. You need to eliminate activities and habits that are not helping you to achieve and maximize your full potential. And what are these activities and habits? You can list them but depending on the situation you are in, some in the list are not impacting your road to maximizing your potential. Say John needs to get a good sleeping habit so that he could focus well, but Jane has no issue about sleeping, but is easily distracted at work or in any activity she is into.<br>
    To help you maximize your full potential, first thing you need to do is reflect on yourself, understand what is missing in your routine, what are the pitfalls you keep on encountering and couldn't adjust to. This part is the one that I struggled, so reflecting on what I did at work and how I treated everyone at work truly matters to me and I have to reflect each and everyday, before, during, or after work - the goal is to improve myself even to its barest, minute degree and un-noticeable level of change in character.<br>
    I could say that if you love what you are doing, as everyone says, you will reach your full potential and fulfill what you've dreamt of. Feeling of of satisfaction and fulfillment, not feeling obligated, puts your physical and mental state at work without revving up and no extra effort needed.<br>
    What if a team encouters a team leader who micromanage? What effect will it has to the team?<a href="file:///C:/Users/User/OneDrive/Desktop/Bio/digitalAgeOfSurveillance.html" target="_blank">(Related: digitalAgeOfSurveillance)</a></p><br>

    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Communicating with this Manager</h4>
    <p>Occasionally, I receive phone call from a particular manager who needs to inform our department that an incident occurred or let's say there is a suspect in custody. This manager I would say is speaking English as his second language just like me.<br>
    I am sure this his written communication is better than his oral communication, but that is beside the point.
    He speaks with courtesy, completeness, concreteness, coherence and name alll the other requirements of an effective  communicator - he has them all. Now I know you are asking so what is the issue?<br>

    Try to visualize my plight, I am in-charge with the majority of oral communication with other departments, handling at least 20 people who demand my time infrequently and coming to me un-scheduled and unpredictable and other
    areas of concern in my timetable that are also demanding time, un-scheduled and unpredictable as well.To cut it short - there is a communication overload!<br>

    This particular manager will narrate the story thoroughly, vividly, full of emotions and in detail, only that the length of details means that I need to take note well, fast and with so much effort while I need to tend to other things.<br>
    My always question is, why he could not summarize the message? This goes on and on for years. I was thinking of giving him a hint that he is becoming extremely annoying, sadly demanding by not improving on this aspect - effective
    communication - brief and case.<br>
    I understand that not all persons has the ability to communicate well, until one time, the turn of events came.
    It was my turn to inform this manager of an incident, and by intention, I tried to provide him of a very detailed and
    vivid narration of the event. I was caught off guard when he told me I will just view the footage inside the CCTV
    viewing room because he said and I quote, "my story is too long". That is the statement I wanted to hear from him for a long time, and next time he is just as detailed as me, I will remind him to be more brief and concise, if that is the
    reasonable thing to do.</p>
