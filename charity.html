    <h3 class="w3-wide w3-animate-left">My Views About Giving</h3><br>
        <p>Charity starts with doing simple acts. It doesn't have to be published, posted, or made known to an intended audience. Giving, whether tangible or intangible has the same value if given with a pure intention.<br>
        There is a positive and hopeful feeling within me when I am planning on giving or sharing without the expectation of a return act. That alone has an impact on me. How much more if I finally execute my plan of giving. That positive feeling is more than when I am just thinking about doing it.<br>
        Giving is universal, it is boundless, it is limitless. It has no discrimination in all sense. Because giving is a natural human act.<br>
        There are so many charities and foundations, and still not enough.
        What must be the reason?
        So many people, so many kinds, so many motives and goals. 
        I want to receive help or receive charity if it is badly needed - If I am in distress. Because the circumstances tell me to receive - if after exhausting all the means possible.
        But some people are comfortable receiving permanently, because of those people who give plainly without communicating with the people in need. At least we say something like "try your best to find a job, find an opportunity to alleviate your plight". This does not go well with everyone. Different situation demands different response. Let us at least try to help people and give them chance to stand up for themselves. This is a more beneficial, imperishable and a higher form of giving. Let us ponder and remind ourselves that giving is immutable.</p>
